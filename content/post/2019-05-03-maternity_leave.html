<h2>A quick look into paid leave available to moms</h2>
<p>I was recently researching maternity leave options in Poland. In simplification as a mother in Poland you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>a year of a paid leave at a rate 80% (20 weeks of maternity leave and 32 of parental leave)</li>
<li>half a year (20 weeks maternity leave + 6 weeks parental leave) paid 100% and another half 60% (26 weeks of parental leave).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use your parental leave straight after maternity leave or in chunks, split with the baby father or combine it with work. I won’t go into too many details of the Polish social security system. I was curious about how this compares to what other countries have to offer. I found out that the situation of Polish mothers looks pretty good, judging based on the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF2_1_Parental_leave_systems.pdf" target="_blank">data</a> from 2016.</p>

<h2>Battle Royale: Time vs. Money</h2>
<p>Just like with any other area of life, it’s also about the trade-off between money and time. The longer you stay with your kid the less money you get. So what would you prefer?</p>
<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly37/" target="_blank">visualization</a> from Datawrapper’s Lisa Rost, I analyzed the 2016 OECD data on the maternity and parental leave available to mothers.</p>
<div id="key-takeaways" class="section level3">
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>OECD 2016 <strong>total paid leave average is 1 year 2 weeks</strong> and <strong>payment rate 61%</strong> of the salary mother’s salary</li>
<li>countries of the former Eastern block offer the longest leave</li>
<li>3 countries with <strong>the longest leave</strong> are: <strong>Estonia</strong> 166 weeks paid 51%, equivalent to 85 weeks paid 100%, <strong>Slovakia</strong> 164 weeks paid 33% (54 weeks 100%), <strong>Hungary</strong> 160 weeks paid 45% (72 weeks 100%)</li>
<li><strong>United States</strong> are the only OECD country that doesn’t offer any sort of leave</li>
<li><strong>Poland</strong> offers pretty good benefits, reaching almost OECD average (2 weeks less) when it comes to a leave duration and offering 20% more money than OECD average.</li>
</ul>
