My name is Olga Mierzwa-Sulima and I am a Data Scientist at <a href="https://appsilon.com" target="_blank">Appsilon</a>. I love solving problems using data, beautiful visualizations, dogs and back-country skiing.

I hold a Master degree in Econometrics from the University of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. I have been working for boutique consulting companies helping global clients, like Unilever, NN or WHO.
I'm huge enthusiast of the statistical programming language R, which is my primary tool at work. Since 2014 I co-organize <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/" target="_blank">Warsaw R Enthusiasts Meetup in Warsaw</a> and co-founded Warsaw R-Ladies chapter. I'm an international speaker and R workshop tutor.

Besides this blog you can find articles I write for <a href="https://appsilon.com/author/olga/" target="_blank">Appsilon blog</a>.

I live and work in Warsaw, Poland with my family.

I care deeply about the environment.
