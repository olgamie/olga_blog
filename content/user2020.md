Recap Tackling climate change useR! 2020 breakout session

On Tuesday July 7th I organized a breakout session tackling climate change at useR!2020 Munich.
When I submited the proposal I hoped the session will be a mix of a invited talk, climated related contributions submited to useR! and open discussion
between R users and researchers. In online setup the final session schedule was a bit different.

Session lasted 2 hours, first part consisted of a short introduction and 2 guest presentations:
* How to join Ai4Good movement by Filip Stachura from Appsilon
* How data science can help climate studies? by Marcin Dyderski from PAS dendrology Insitute.
Every presentation was followed by the questions from the audience.
Presentation part was recorded and is available on confrence YouTube: [link]

Second part was open discussion between the session participants. Due to high number of participants approx. 130 together I decided
to split the discussion between the breakout rooms. Main points that were discussed: how to find projects and deciede what to work on,
how to find fellow R users, where to seek help related to R during climate related research or projects. There was an eagerness to keep in touch and
create a space for information exchange. The result is Slack:
