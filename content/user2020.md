Recap Tackling climate change useR! 2020 breakout session

On Tuesday July 7th I organized a breakout session tackling climate change at a virtual useR!2020 Munich.
When I submited the proposal I hoped the session will be a mix of a invited talk, climat related contributions submited to useR! and an open discussion
between R users and researchers. In an online setup the final session schedule was a bit different.

Session lasted 2 hours. First part consisted of a short introduction and 2 guest presentations:

* How to join Ai4Good movement by [Filip Stachura](https://twitter.com/filipstachura?lang=en) from [Appsilon Data Science](https://appsilon.com/ai-for-good/)
* How data scientists can help in climate studies? by [Marcin Dyderski](https://twitter.com/mkdyderski?lang=en) from PAS Dendrology Insitute.
Every presentation was followed by the questions from the audience.
Presentation part was recorded and is available on [the confrence YouTub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzmj0cFLfic&feature=emb_logo).

Second part was an open discussion between the session participants. Due to high number of participants approx. 130 I was afraid it won't be possible to
manage the crowd and decided to split the discussion between the breakout rooms. https://appsilon.com/ai-for-good/
Main points that were discussed: how to find projects and deciede what to work on,
how to find fellow R users, where to seek help related to R during climate related research or projects. There was an eagerness to keep in touch and
create a space for information exchange. The result is [a Slack group](https://userstackling-uny5880.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-fkocefo6-kkRLrPqPI5WQR5P~HLdm9A#/) for R users interested in engaging further in climate change discussion. Dave Parr, one of the session's participant, is currating a [list](https://github.com/DaveParr/awesome-climate-data) of companies, communities, datasets and other resources o increase our awareness and ability to act on the climate emergency.

To sum up I really didn't know how many people would be interested in climate change subject at a useR! conference. A short survey to estimate the participation that I've run before the event suggested that there will be 20 people joining. I was blown away by the true number of participants from so diverse backgrounds and location.
